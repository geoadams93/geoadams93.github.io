<div class=WordSection1 style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">

<p class=MsoTitle align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Algerian'>Alsamin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This document serves as a primer for the fantasy world
Alsamin, where this D&amp;D campaign takes place. Within it will describe a
brief description and history of the world as well as the major nations and
people. Knowledge within can help you decide what your character’s background,
motivations, and relationships are. </p>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>The world</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alsamin is the name of the world and the sole continent that
makes up the livable land. Sailors who attempt to sail beyond are eventually
met with “The Roil” areas of the world where the laws of nature and reality
start to bend and travel beyond is not possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The current age is known as The Silver Age named such as a
marked decline from The Golden Age, when Gods walked among mortals wielding the
power of Divinity, which allowed them to shape reality at will. The Gods
disappeared ten thousand years ago, although many traces of their existence
remain in the world, including the power of the clerics that worship them.</p>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>The Four Empires</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The focus of the world is on the “Four Empires” whose
politics and conflicts shape the lives of everyone. They dominate the one and
only continent of the world, although small kingdoms lay within their spheres
of influence yet remain nominally independent.</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>Catatan</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Catatan is the youngest of the four, and literally means
“union” in Elvish. It is a collection of crowns held together in personal union
by a king. Carrying the ancient traditions of the Elves alongside the customs
of the Men of the North it is a cosmopolitan entity that is only considered to
be an Empire in the loosest sense. Existing for decades in an interregnum,
scheming members of the royal council direct the affairs of the nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people of Catatan are made up of many ancestries.
Gnomes, Elves, Halflings, and many others call Catatan home. The vast majority
of the populace are Humans and Half-Elves. The majority language is Elvish,
descended from ancient Celestial and Sylvan.  </p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>The Karani Empire</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Karani Empire is old and proud. Conquerors who claim
descent from the original human civilizations, they preside over the largest of
the Four Empires. Most of their land is arid and uninhabited. The majority of
the population clings to the banks of the great World River.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Empire is ruled by a Tamar, the title for the absolute
monarch descended from Tamar the Great. The Karani people are proud of the
technological ingenuity and cultural influence they wield. They were the ones
to first invent firearms, their language – Common - is the lingua franca of the
known world, and they claim the most relics and temples of the past Golden Age.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people are mostly Humans, however the vast size of the
empire means many smaller groups of all races live within. </p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>The Raabatine Republic</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The smallest of the empires, both in terms of land and
population, the Raabatine Republic’s power is in its great wealth. Founded by
priests fleeing the Karani Empire due to their views that their worship was
being twisted and corrupted for political reasons, they set out to the dangerous
Raaba archipelago. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They have an extreme laizzez-faire attitude toward
governance. As long as they are able to carry out their holy duties, they are
ambivalent towards the laws of the republic. This has led to abundant wealth
flowing through the republics, but slavery and plutocratic corruption is rife. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The republic is so named as the rulership is nominally done
so via collective voting from the heads of the major temples, however merchant
lords hold all the real sway. Anyone of sufficient means may claim to be a
“lord”, limited only by the ability to protect that claim. The Silk Lord, Sugar
Lord and many others claim these titles and monopolies. All however envy the
power of the mysterious Spice King, who has never been physically seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All different people of all backgrounds live in the republics,
but many reflect the Karani background of the original settlers.</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>The Rao Dynasty</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Dwarven Rao Dynasty, Rao being “Dragon” in Dwarvish
claims divine descent from their chief god Father Mountain. The theocratic
state is said to be ruled by the cyclically reincarnating souls of Father
Mountain’s dragon sons incarnated into their Emperor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Generally isolationist, the vast majority of the population
are Dwarves. Dragonborn exist within the empire, as do minorities of other
groups.  Dwarvish is the common language, although many of the populace
understand the liturgical language Draconic. </p>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Faiths</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many religious traditions in the world, and even
so there are those who profess no faith. Within the Rao Dynasty or Karani
Empire there are state religions, but even so faith is a personal thing to the
denizens of the world.</p>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>The Old Gods</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the worship of the various entities that claimed
Divinity in the Golden Age. This is the state religion of the Karani Empire,
and the faith expressed by the settlers in the Raabatine Republics. Some
example deities are:<br>
<br>
Magapala: Goddess of water and the sea. Depicted as a jovial merfolk queen. She
is commonly worshipped by sailors and merchants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Karor: God of stone and strength. Depicted as a stone giant
with a grim countenance. Commonly worshipped by builders and soldiers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Muraga: Goddess of the dead and dying. Depicted as a three
headed dog feasting on the dead. Commonly worshipped by those who seek an end
to their suffering or the desperate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are uncountable Old Gods, some representing local
areas to those whose portfolio are common and widespread. Usually, laypersons
give homage to many Old Gods, while a cleric may serve one their whole life.</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>The Path of Ascension</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A religious revival among those with Elvish ancestry in the
Catatan, this movement teaches its followers to strive to live a “perfect”
life. Those who manage to do so through acts of goodness and charity may gather
the strength to ascend to the Angelos, becoming a celestial and leaving the
physical world. Those who follow this faith worship no deities, but many
clerics and paladins give homage to the core concepts of this faith and manage
to draw holy power.</p>

<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>Father Mountain</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The religion of the Dwarves, they worship Father Mountain
who they claim created them and their mountainous home. They also give
reverence to his two sons who took the form of two great metallic dragons. When
the two brothers fought over how to best carry out their father’s wishes, he
forced the two to be mortal and rule the dwarven people as a humble dwarf. The
most centralized and organized religion in the world, it is generally only
followed by dwarves. There are, however, syncretic movements that seek to
consolidate the worship of Father Mountain with the Old Gods. </p>

<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Your Story</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are an Adventurer. This is a regulated profession in the
world governed by the Adventurer’s Guild. The guild is headquartered in the City
of Tamar’s Tomb, located within the Kingsbane Swamp located in the neutral
territories between the Four Empires. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A war has broken out between the Four Empires, with The Rao
and Karani Empires allying against the Catatan and Raabatine Republics. Per the
laws of the guild, you and your party have been summoned to attend a summit in
Tamar’s Tomb or be branded outlaws. </p>
